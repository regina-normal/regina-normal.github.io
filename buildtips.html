This page offers tips and tricks for building Regina successfully on
various operating systems.
</p>
<p>
As always, it is
<b>much simpler to download and install a ready-made package</b> if you can.
Check out the
<a href="index.html#download">Regina download tables</a>
and see if your distribution is supported.
</p>
<p>
Please also see the page on <a href="source.html">building from sources</a>,
which lists the system requirements and gives a general overview of the
build process.
</p>
<p>
If these tips do not work for you, please mail the authors
(including your <tt>CMakeCache.txt</tt> if possible) so that we can
update the build scripts (and this page) to reflect systems like yours.
</p>

<h2><a name="linux">GNU/Linux</a></h2>

<p>
Since version&nbsp;4.92, Regina can be installed anywhere (it does not
need to live directly beneath <tt>/usr</tt> as in the past).
The default is to install in <tt>/usr/local</tt>, though you can change this
if you like by passing the argument <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt> to cmake:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/bab/software ..</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
If you run a 64-bit version of linux (the <tt>x86_64</tt> or
<tt>amd64</tt> architectures) and you use an RPM-based distribution
(such as Fedora, Mandriva or SuSE),
you may wish to set <tt>LIB_SUFFIX</tt>:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 ..</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
This ensures that Regina's libraries are installed in a 64-bit directory
such as <tt>/usr/local/lib64/</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Debian-based distributions (such as Debian or Ubuntu) do not use special
directory names for 64-bit systems, and you should
<b>not set <tt>LIB_SUFFIX</tt></b> on such machines.
</p>

<h2><a name="macosx">Mac</a></h2>

<p>
The macOS build has evolved to remove the need for
software environments such as
<a href="http://finkproject.org/">Fink</a> or
<a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>
(and indeed,
the macOS binaries here on the Regina website were built on a system
without any such environment installed at all).
The current situation is as follows:
<ul>
<li>To build a standalone app bundle (like the one here on the Regina
website), you will need to build Regina in Xcode. Regina's git source
tree includes a full Xcode project, but this is heavily tailored to the
developer's personal setup and so it may need some work to build on your
machine.
<li>Alternatively, you can have a full unix-like installation (with programs
in <tt>/usr/local/bin/</tt>, libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib/</tt>
data in <tt>/usr/local/share/regina/</tt> and so on).
<b>This is the much simpler option</b>, and it is supported
out-of-the-box; read on for details.
</ul>
<p>
For a full unix-like installation, assuming you already have
an environment like
<a href="http://finkproject.org/">Fink</a> or
<a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> installed,
you may need to pass additional arguments to cmake:
<ul>
<li>If you wish to use the system python installation (or some other
python installation) instead of Fink's or MacPorts', set
<tt>Python_EXECUTABLE</tt> to the python interpreter
(e.g., <tt>/usr/bin/python</tt>).</li>
<li>If you want to change the installation prefix from the
default <tt>/usr/local</tt>, set <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt>.
This controls where the application bundle will appear when you run
<tt>make&nbsp;install</tt>.</li>
<li>If you have downloaded Qt separately (not via Fink/MacPorts), you
need to tell Regina where to find it. Set <tt>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</tt> to the
relevant Qt directory containing <tt>include/</tt>, <tt>lib/</tt> and so on.
For a typical Qt installation, this looks something like
<tt>.../Qt5.7.0/5.7/clang_64</tt>.</li>
<li>You do <b>not</b> need to set <tt>REGINA_INSTALL_TYPE</tt> to <tt>XDG</tt>,
since this is now the default (and indeed the only valid option) on macOS.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A complete example of a cmake line using Fink:
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
<tt>example$ cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/bab/software
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/bab/Qt5/5.7/clang_64
..</tt>
</p>
</div>
<p>
A complete example using MacPorts that uses the Qt and Python from MacPorts,
and installs Regina in the default location <tt>/usr/local/</tt>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<p>
<tt>example$ cmake -DPython_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/bin/python3.8 ..</tt>
</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="windows">Windows</a></h2>

<p>
Building Regina under Windows is possible but extremely messy.
If you are working with Regina's sources, we highly recommend that
you do this under GNU/Linux or macOS.
</p>
<p>
If you really need to get a Windows build running, please mail the
authors for assistance.
Alternatively, you can look in
<a href="https://github.com/regina-normal/aux/tree/master/packaging/windows">Regina's packaging repository</a>
to get some idea of what the Regina developer has been doing to build
the Windows binaries that you see here on the Regina website.
</p>

<h2><a name="cluster">Cluster environments</a></h2>

<p>
If you plan to use Regina in a high-performance computing environment
such as a university cluster, there are several complications.
</p>
<h4>Disabling the graphical user interface</h4>
<p>
You will probably <i>not</i> want to
build the graphical user interface (in fact the cluster may well
not have the Qt development libraries installed, which would cause
cmake to fail).
To fix this, set the argument <tt>DISABLE_GUI</tt>:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ cmake -DDISABLE_GUI=1 ..</tt>
</p></div>
<h4>Installing beneath your home directory</h4>
<p>
You will almost certainly not have root access
to the cluster, which means you will need to install Regina beneath your
home directory.  You do this by creating a top-level install directory
(say <tt>/home/bab/software</tt>) and then passing it as the install prefix
to cmake:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ cmake -DDISABLE_GUI=1
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/bab/software ..</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Regina will now install its various components in the subdirectories
<tt>/home/bab/software/bin</tt>,
<tt>/home/bab/software/lib</tt>,
<tt>/home/bab/software/share</tt> and so on.
</p>
<p>
You should pass an <b>absolute path</b> as your install prefix
(not <tt>~/software</tt> or <tt>../software</tt>, for instance).
It is best if this is not the directory in which
you unpacked Regina's sources, since otherwise you may find it hard to
untangle sources from binaries later on.
</p>
<h4>Compiling your own software against Regina</h4>
<p>
Once Regina is built and installed, you may wish to compile it
into your own C++ programs.  The helper script <tt>regina-engine-config</tt>
gives you all of the necessary compiler and linker options for doing this.
You can find this script with the other programs in
<tt><i>prefix</i>/bin</tt>, where <tt><i>prefix</i></tt> is your
installation prefix.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a full set of compiler options:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ regina-engine-config --cflags</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
To obtain a full set of linker options:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ regina-engine-config --libs</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
You can use this script directly on the command-line (or in your
Makefile).  So, for instance, to compile the program <tt>myprog.cpp</tt>
against Regina:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ g++ `regina-engine-config --cflags --libs` myprog.cpp
-o myprog</tt>
</p></div>
