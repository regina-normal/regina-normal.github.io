   <span class="application">Regina</span> 7.0 brings an enormous overhaul across the entire
   codebase—possibly the largest overhaul in almost two decades.
   There has been signficant work to insulate users from these changes:
   the bulk of these changes should only be visible to <span class="application">C++</span> programmers, but
   there are important behavioural changes that will affect everybody.
  </p><p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>Some of these changes break backward compatibility.</em></span>
  </p><p>
   If you are migrating from <span class="application">Regina</span> ≤ 6.0.1, you should read the
   brief summary below so you understand the most important changes.
  </p><p>
   <span class="application">C++</span> and <span class="application">Python</span> programmers can find a more fine-grained
   explanation of the <span class="acronym">API</span> changes on the
   <a href="https://regina-normal.github.io/api/regina7.html" target="_top"><span class="application">Regina</span>
   website</a>.
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="regina7-fileformat"></a>A new, more flexible file format</h3></div></div></div><p>
    <span class="application">Regina</span>'s data file format has changed.  <span class="application">Regina</span> 7.0 can read
    your old data files, but <span class="application">Regina</span> 6.0.1 and earlier will not be
    able to read files from newer versions of <span class="application">Regina</span>.
   </p><p>
    If you need to export a file so that <span class="application">Regina</span> ≤ 6.0.1
    can read it, you use the command-line
    <a href="man-regconvert.html" title="regconvert"><span xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="command"><span><strong class="command">regconvert</strong></span></span></a>
    utility, or the
    <a href="foreign-export.html#export-rga" title="Regina Data Files"><span xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="guiitem"><span class="guimenu">File</span></span>→<span xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="guiitem"><span class="guisubmenu">Export</span></span></a>
    menu in the user interface.
   </p><p>
    A major advantage of the new file format is that different packets
    no longer depend on each other.  In particular, if you create a
    normal surface, hypersurface or angle structure list from a
    triangulation, you can later change the triangulation, or move it to
    a separate location in the tree, or even delete it.
    The list will make its own copy of the original triangulation if
    this becomes necessary (which you can
    <a href="surfaces-analysis.html" title="Analysis">access through the header</a>
    of the normal surface, hypersurface or angle structure viewer).
    Likewise, the list will bundle this copy of the original triangulation
    into the data file if necessary.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="regina7-highdim"></a>Dimensions 9–15 removed by default</h3></div></div></div><p>
    For several years, <span class="application">Regina</span> has supported triangulations of
    dimensions 2–15.  However, these higher dimensions add
    significant overhead (even if you are not using them), particularly
    for <span class="application">Python</span> users.
   </p><p>
    For this reason, <span class="application">Regina</span> 7.0 now only includes dimensions
    2–8 by default.  In particular, if you open a data file
    containing triangulations of dimension 9–15 and then save the
    file again, <span class="emphasis"><em>these triangulations will be lost</em></span>.
   </p><p>
    If you need to work with dimensions 9–15, you can make your own
    <a href="https://regina-normal.github.io/buildtips.html#highdim" target="_top">custom
    build</a> of <span class="application">Regina</span>; be sure to pass the option
    <code class="literal">-DHIGHDIM=1</code> to <span xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="command"><span><strong class="command">cmake</strong></span></span>.
    Also perhaps drop Ben an email so he knows that there are users who
    want these features.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="regina7-python"></a><span class="application">Python</span> is a first-class citizen</h3></div></div></div><p>
    For the first time, <span class="application">Python</span> users now have access to essentially
    <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> inside <span class="application">Regina</span>'s <span class="application">C++</span> calculation
    engine.  You can use functions that take callbacks (e.g., the
    exhaustive retriangulation code, census generation, and subgroup
    enumeration), and you can access low-level algorithms (e.g., the linear
    programming code, or the double description method and
    Hilbert basis enumeration).
   </p><p>
    <span class="application">Python</span> now supports iteration wherever <span class="application">C++</span> does, using
    lightweight iterator objects where possible:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; for e in Example3.lens(8,3).edges():
...     print(e)
...
Edge 0, internal, degree 4: 0 (01), 0 (20), 1 (10), 0 (13)
Edge 1, internal, degree 4: 0 (03), 1 (02), 1 (31), 0 (21)
Edge 2, internal, degree 4: 0 (23), 1 (30), 1 (23), 1 (12)</pre><p>
    Almost all classes now provide a more informative <span class="application">Python</span> representation:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; ExampleLink.trefoil().group()
&lt;regina.GroupPresentation: &lt; a b | a^-2 b a b &gt;&gt;</pre><p>
    The equality comparisons (<code class="literal">==</code> and <code class="literal">!=</code>)
    now compare their <span class="emphasis"><em>contents</em></span> by value for most classes.
    The main exceptions are objects whose location in memory defines them
    (e.g., faces and simplices in triangulations, or crossings in links),
    and objects whose purpose is to manage an expensive computation
    (e.g., progress trackers or census managers); these still compare by
    reference.  Each class has an <code class="literal">equalityType</code>
    constant that tells you how its objects are compared.
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Example3.lens(8,3).homology() == AbelianGroup(0, [8])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; AbelianGroup.equalityType
&lt;EqualityType.BY_VALUE: 1&gt;</pre><p>
    In line with the <span class="application">C++</span> changes described below, <span class="application">Regina</span> now throws
    exceptions upon error in some settings instead of returning
    <code class="literal">None</code>
    (e.g., <code class="literal">Triangulation3.fromIsoSig()</code>);
    see the <span class="acronym">API</span> documentation for details on which exceptions
    each function might throw (if any).
   </p><p>
    Mathematical objects such as triangulations and links are no longer
    packets (i.e., they do not live in a packet tree or belong to a
    data file by default); this is for performance reasons.
    If you just want to work with a triangulation or link, you can
    use <code class="literal">Triangulation3</code> or <code class="literal">Link</code> as before;
    however, if you want to insert one of these objects into a packet tree
    then you will need to use the corresponding classes
    <code class="literal">PacketOfTriangulation3</code>
    or <code class="literal">PacketOfLink</code> (and so on for other types of object).
    These packet classes inherit from <code class="literal">Triangulation3</code>,
    <code class="literal">Link</code>, etc., and can be used in much the same way.
   </p><p>
    Finally, although there are far fewer changes to the <span class="application">Python</span> <span class="acronym">API</span>
    than for <span class="application">C++</span>, there is one change that will likely affect most people:
    to enumerate normal surfaces or angle structures, you no longer
    use the old <code class="literal">enumerate()</code> functions.  Instead,
    just create a new <code class="literal">NormalSurfaces</code> or
    <code class="literal">AngleStructures</code> object:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = Example3.poincare()
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = NormalSurfaces(t, NS_STANDARD)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(s)
7 embedded, vertex surfaces (Standard normal (tri-quad))</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="regina7-cpp"></a><span class="application">C++</span> embraces modern standards and value semantics</h3></div></div></div><p>
    <span class="application">Regina</span> began in the late 1990s, before <span class="application">C++</span> was ever
    standardised.  Since then, <span class="application">Regina</span>'s <span class="acronym">API</span> has slowly evolved as
    the language changed, incrementally making use of new language
    features, and removing old workarounds as they became no longer
    necessary.
   </p><p>
    One of the most important changes to the <span class="application">C++</span> language was the much
    improved <span class="emphasis"><em>value semantics</em></span> that came with <span class="application">C++11</span>.
    When used with the new <span class="application">C++11</span> move operations, this made it both easy
    and efficient to pass large objects around by value, not by pointer.
    The resulting code reads more naturally, is typically less error-prone,
    avoids the need for manual memory management, and still retains the
    performance of the old pointer-based code.
   </p><p>
    In <span class="application">Regina</span> 7.0, the <span class="application">C++</span> <span class="acronym">API</span> has undergone a complete overhaul
    from head to toe.  The <span class="acronym">API</span> now uses the <span class="application">C++17</span> standard.
    Widespread changes include:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
      <span class="application">Regina</span> now uses value semantics across the board.  So, for
      example, <code class="literal">Triangulation&lt;3&gt;::fromIsoSig()</code>
      now returns a <code class="literal">Triangulation&lt;3&gt;</code> by value.
      Most of your objects should now be able to live on the stack;
      in general there should no need for manual memory management via
      <code class="literal">new</code> and <code class="literal">delete</code>.
      The main exceptions are objects that are defined by their locations
      in memory, such as faces and simplices in triangulations,
      or crossings in links: these are still passed by pointer, but
      their memory is safely managed by their enclosing triangulations or links.
     </p></li><li><p>
      Likewise, functions that used to return newly-allocated pointers now
      return by value.  If they used to return <code class="literal">null</code> when
      unexpected errors occurred, they typically now throw exceptions;
      if they used to return <code class="literal">null</code> in ordinary scenarios
      where there is no solution, they typically now return a
      <code class="literal">std::optional</code>.
     </p></li><li><p>
      When returning polymorphic objects (such as
      <code class="literal">Packet</code> or <code class="literal">StandardTriangulation</code>),
      you cannot avoid returning by pointer since the exact type is not known
      at compile time.  In such cases, <span class="application">Regina</span> now returns a smart pointer
      (typically <code class="literal">std::shared_ptr</code> for packets and
      <code class="literal">std::unique_ptr</code> for other types of object).
     </p></li><li><p>
      Functions that used to take arguments by pointer now typically
      take them either by value or by const reference.  Many functions
      that used to return multiple values via reference arguments
      now return a <code class="literal">std::tuple</code> instead.
     </p></li><li><p>
      The class hierarchies have been simplified considerably.  Hopefully
      one side-effect of this is that the <span class="acronym">API</span> documentation is easier to
      navigate.
     </p></li><li><p>
      Functions that take callbacks (such as census generation or
      exhaustive retriangulation) are now more flexible, and can work with
      lambdas and arbitrary lists of properly-typed arguments.
      They no longer take function pointers with untyped
      <code class="literal">(void*)</code> arguments.
     </p></li><li><p>
      Packets are now managed <span class="emphasis"><em>exclusively</em></span> by shared
      pointers.  You should never be holding on to to a raw pointer to a
      packet type.  The large mathematical classes such as
      <code class="literal">Triangulation&lt;dim&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">Link</code>
      are no longer packet types, since this frees them from considerable
      overhead; if you need to insert them into a packet tree then you
      should use <code class="literal">PacketOf&lt;Triangulation&lt;3&gt;&gt;</code>,
      <code class="literal">PacketOf&lt;Link&gt;</code>, and so on.  There is a
      new suite of <code class="literal">make_packet()</code> functions to help you
      with this.
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
   </p><p>
    Since <span class="application">Regina</span> 7.0 is a “big release” that breaks backward
    compatibility, this was a good time to clean up and simplify many other
    unwieldy parts of the <span class="acronym">API</span>.  These changes range from simple renamings
    (e.g., <code class="literal">StandardTriangulation::isStandardTriangulation</code>
    becomes <code class="literal">StandardTriangulation::recognise</code>) through to
    major semantic changes (e.g., each normal surface now stores an
    <span class="emphasis"><em>encoding</em></span>, which is to some degree independent
    of the coordinate system that was used to create it).
   </p><p>
    If you are writing <span class="application">C++</span> code that links against <span class="application">Regina</span>, you
    <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> need to change your code.  Generally the
    issues should be flagged by the compiler (not discovered at runtime),
    and the necesssary changes should be obvious.  Some old functions
    have been kept but marked as deprecated to ease the transition; your
    compiler should warn you also if you are still using these.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="regina7-tons"></a>TONS removed temporarily</h3></div></div></div><p>
    For a long time, <span class="application">Regina</span> has offered “experimental”
    support for transversely oriented normal surfaces (TONS).
    This always came with large caveats and promises that things would break,
    and needed to be explicitly enabled before it could be used.
   </p><p>
    Now that the normal surface classes have undergone a major redesign,
    TONS no longer fits cleanly into the normal surface model (since in
    some fundamental sense they are not normal surfaces), and so this support
    has been removed completely from <span class="application">Regina</span>.
   </p><p>
    The intention is to reimplement TONS “properly”
    in a future release, using their own separate suite of classes
    that more accurately reflect what they are and how they behave.
