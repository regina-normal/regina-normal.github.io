<div class="textblock"><p >Regina's calculation engine is provided as a shared C++ library, and this API documentation is written to describe Regina's native C++ interface.</p>
<p >However, Regina also makes this library accessible through a Python module. If you are using Python, the notes below explain (briefly) how you should read this API documentation.</p>
<h3>Python vs C++ types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Standard C++ types become native Python types. For example, the C++ type <code>std::string</code> becomes the native Python string type, the C++ type <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</code> becomes a native Python list holding objects of type <em>T</em>, and the C++ type <code>std::optional&lt;T&gt;</code> will either become a Python object of type <em>T</em> or the Python value <code>None</code>.</li>
<li>Everything within the C++ namespace <em>regina</em> becomes part of the Python module <code>regina</code>. For example, the C++ class <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Link.html" title="Represents a directed knot or link in the 3-sphere.">regina::Link</a> becomes the Python class <code><a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Link.html" title="Represents a directed knot or link in the 3-sphere.">regina.Link</a></code>.</li>
<li>Regina has many templated classes, and Python does not support templates. Typically Regina will replace the template arguments with an appropriate suffix in the Python class name. For example, the C++ class <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Triangulation_3_013_01_4.html" title="Represents a 3-dimensional triangulation, typically of a 3-manifold.">Triangulation&lt;3&gt;</a> becomes the Python class <code>Triangulation3</code>, and the C++ class Matrix&lt;regina::Integer&gt; becomes the Python class <code>MatrixInt</code>. See the individual class notes for how the Python class names are constructed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python vs C++ APIs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since Regina 7.0, almost <em>all</em> of Regina's C++ classes and functions are wrapped in Python - even the low-level and/or highly specialised classes - wherever it is meaningful to do so. However, sometimes there is reason why a class or function cannot or should not be wrapped. If a class or function is not available in Python then you will see a bold <b>Python:</b> note indicating this. See for instance the class <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1MarkedVector.html" title="A vector of objects with fast, space-efficient reverse lookup of array indices.">MarkedVector</a>, or the function <a class="el" href="group__utilities.html#gae40c2e62bf0908919834ea10762def19" title="Converts the entire given string to an 8-bit integer and reports whether this conversion was successf...">valueOf()</a>.</li>
<li>Most of Regina's classes and functions use the same interface in both C++ and Python, but occasionally there are differences in how the classes or functions are used. Again, you will see a bold <b>Python:</b> note indicating this. See for instance the method <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Link.html#aeadc3ba80f5f033f8b306a718b06566c" title="Explores all knot diagrams that can be reached from this via Reidemeister moves, without exceeding a ...">Link::rewrite()</a>, or the global function <a class="el" href="namespaceregina.html#a52c8776c5329496a0b34c914706031e4" title="Writes time and memory usage for the current process to the given output stream, for use on Linux sys...">writeResUsage()</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing equality</h3>
<p >It is important to understand how the comparisons <code>x == y</code> and <code>x is y</code> operate under Python. As of Regina 7.0, this behaviour has changed significantly: many more classes now compare by value, and a few now have their comparisons disabled.</p>
<p >In general, you do <em>not</em> want to use the Python test <code>x is y</code>. This is because each of Regina's Python objects is typically a "wrapper" that points to one of Regina's native C++ objects. Importantly, the same native C++ object could have many Python wrappers, and so <code>x is y</code> could return <code>False</code> even if both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> wrap the same native C++ object.</p>
<p >Instead, you should always use the tests <code>x == y</code> and/or <code>x != y</code>. Regina implements this in different ways, depending on the type of class:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Most of Regina's classes use <em>comparison by value</em>. Here <code>x == y</code> tests whether the <em>contents</em> of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are the same. What "the same " means will depend on the particular class; for example, <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1GroupPresentation.html" title="Represents a finite presentation of a group.">GroupPresentation</a> tests for identical presentations (not group isomorphism), <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Triangulation_3_013_01_4.html" title="Represents a 3-dimensional triangulation, typically of a 3-manifold.">Triangulation&lt;3&gt;</a> tests for the same tetrahedron and vertex labellings (not just combinatorial isomorphism), and <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Attachment.html" title="A packet that can hold an arbitrary file attachment.">Attachment</a> compares the attached file contents (ignoring the associated filenames). For the core numeric classes such as Integer, <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Rational.html" title="Represents an arbitrary precision rational number.">Rational</a>, <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Polynomial.html" title="Represents a single-variable polynomial with coefficients of type T.">Polynomial</a>, VectorInt and MatrixInt, this tests the usual mathematical equality.</p>
<p class="startli">For each such class, you can find out what is being compared by reading the documentation for the C++ class operators == and !=. See for example <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Link.html#aa7ca68202fe7b9672c314b5c7f214e9f" title="Determines if this link diagram is combinatorially identical to the given link diagram.">Link::operator==()</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Some selected classes use <em>comparison by reference</em>. Here <code>x == y</code> tests whether <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> refer to the same underlying C++ object (analogous to how <code>x is y</code> would normally behave in a native Python application). This is typically used for the few classes that are passed around by pointer in C++, and whose location in memory is what defines them; the most common examples you will see are crossings within links (<a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Crossing.html" title="Represents a single crossing in a link diagram.">Crossing</a>), and skeletal objects within triangulations (e.g., Tetrahedron&lt;3&gt;, Vertex&lt;4&gt;, BoundaryComponent&lt;2&gt;). This is also used with objects that manage or track long computations (e.g., <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1ProgressTracker.html" title="Manages percentage-based progress tracking and cancellation polling for long operations.">ProgressTracker</a>, GluingPermSearcher4, or <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1TreeEnumeration.html" title="The main entry point for the tree traversal algorithm to enumerate all vertex normal or almost normal...">TreeEnumeration</a>).</p>
<p class="startli">These classes do not provide C++ class operators == or !=.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">A few classes have explicitly disabled their comparison operators, since they are designed to be moved and/or copied (which makes it inappropriate to compare by reference), but they do not yet have their own customised comparisons implemented (often because such a test would be expensive and/or would be difficult to define cleanly).</p>
<p class="startli">These classes do not provide C++ class operators == or !=. If you attempt to compare two Python objects of such a class, you will receive a Python error with a message explain essentially what is written here.</p>
</li>
<li>For some classes, comparisons are irrelevant because they only contain static methods, and you cannot instantiate them. Examples of such classes are <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Example_3_013_01_4.html" title="Offers routines for constructing a variety of sample 3-dimensional triangulations.">Example&lt;3&gt;</a> and <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1i18n_1_1Locale.html">Locale</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p >If you wish to find out how a particular class <em>C</em> behaves, you can examine the attribute <code>C.equalityType</code>. This will return one of the values <code>BY_VALUE</code>, <code>BY_REFERENCE</code>, <code>DISABLED</code> or <code>NEVER_INSTANTIATED</code> respctively:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt;&gt;&gt; print Triangulation3.equalityType</div>
<div class="line">BY_VALUE</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p ><a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Packet.html" title="Represents a packet of information that may be individually edited or operated upon.">Packet</a> subclasses are a special case: it is often meaningful to compare packets by value (e.g., testing whether two triangulations are combinatorially identical), but it is also useful to know whether two Python wrappers identify the same underlying C++ packet (e.g., when traversing the packet tree). To resolve this, you can compare two packets of the same type by value using the operators <code>x == y</code> and <code>x != y</code>, and you can test whether two packets of any types reference the same underlying object by calling <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Packet.html#a381fa20979fb976c4cfc0ba6fc38f1c1" title="Determines whether this and the given object refer to the same packet.">Packet::samePacket()</a>.</p>
<h3>International and special characters</h3>
<p >If you use special characters (such as accented letters, other international characters, exotic punctuation, mathematical symbols and so on), you may need to think about <em>text encodings</em> when passing strings between Python and Regina.</p>
<p >For Python 3 users, this is simple: all strings in Python are unicode, and these are converted seamlessly and transparently when moving between Regina and Python.</p>
<p >For Python 2 users, you need to take some care. All <code>unicode</code> objects will be converted correctly and transparently. If you have a Python string, however, you will need to ensure it is encoded in UTF-8 when passing it to Regina. Conversely, you should assume that all strings that Regina sends back to Python will be UTF-8-encoded. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/unicode.html">https://docs.python.org/2.7/howto/unicode.html</a> for more information on how to work with UTF-8 strings in Python 2.</p>
<p >See the page on <a class="el" href="i18n.html">encodings for international strings</a> for further discussion on text encodings within Regina, including an important note regarding filenames. </p>
