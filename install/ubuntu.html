<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Ubuntu</a></h1>

<p>
Many Ubuntu releases come with Regina &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; as part of
their standard <i>universe</i> software collection.  However, the version of
Regina that ships with each Ubuntu release is fixed (e.g., Ubuntu&nbsp;22.04
ships with Regina&nbsp;7.0, and Ubuntu&nbsp;25.10 ships with Regina&nbsp;7.3.1).
</p>
<p>
If you wish to keep up-to-date with the <b>newest version</b> of Regina,
follow the instructions below.
</p>
<div class="warning"><p>
<b>Note:</b> If you try to view Regina's
documentation through the <i>Help</i> menu, you may see a &ldquo;File
not found&rdquo; error.  This is because Ubuntu ships Firefox as a
snap (not a regular package), which <b>cannot read locally installed
HTML files</b>.
<br><br>
Regina simply asks the desktop environment (e.g., GNOME or KDE) for your
preferred HTML viewer.  Therefore, if you wish to fix this, the best suggestion
for now is to change the file associations in your desktop settings
so that HTML files are opened by a different browser (one that actually has
permissions to read locally installed documentation).
<br><br>
Alternatively, you can always
<a href="../docs/">read the handbook online here</a> and
<a href="../engine-docs/">read the API documentation online here</a>.
</p></div>
<p>
<b>You only need to follow these installation steps
the first time you install Regina.</b>
After this, Ubuntu's package manager will handle upgrades for you,
just like for any other Ubuntu package.
</p>
<p>
The instructions below only install the main packages
<tt>regina-normal</tt> and <tt>regina-normal-doc</tt>, which is all that
most people will need.
If you are a C++ programmer and you wish to build Regina into your own
projects, you should also install the package <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt>.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Install the <tt>debian-keyring</tt> package.  This will give you
Regina's cryptographic signing key (since Ben is a Debian developer).
To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo apt-get install debian-keyring</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li><p>
Download Regina's repository description, according to your version of
Ubuntu:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ubuntu 25.10 (questing):
<a href="../repos/regina-questing.sources"><tt>regina-questing.sources</tt></a></p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 25.04 (plucky):
<a href="../repos/regina-plucky.sources"><tt>regina-plucky.sources</tt></a></p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble):
<a href="../repos/regina-noble.sources"><tt>regina-noble.sources</tt></a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>
Copy the file you just downloaded into Ubuntu's sources directory
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</tt>, as shown below (replacing
<span class="placeholder"><tt>~/Downloads/regina-VERSION.sources</tt></span>
with the location of the file you downloaded):
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo cp -i
<span class="placeholder">~/Downloads/regina-VERSION.sources</span>
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
<b>Note the suffix .d on the directory name!</b>
You do <b>not</b> want to overwrite <tt>sources.list</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Update the list of available packages.  To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo apt-get update</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
If you see an error like <i>&ldquo;the public key is not available&rdquo;</i>,
it may be because you forgot to install <tt>debian-keyring</tt>
in the first step.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Install or upgrade Regina like you would any other package.  Type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo apt-get install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
If you had previously added Regina's repository as a
single line in <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> (possibly via the
graphical <i>Software&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Updates</i> application),
you can delete that older entry now.
The new file that you just downloaded encodes the same repository
but with better security.
(The old source will still work, so there is no urgency to change.)
