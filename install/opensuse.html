<h1><a name="contents">Regina for openSUSE Leap</a></h1>

<p>
Regina now offers openSUSE packages through online package repositories.
This helps openSUSE to find and install dependencies automatically.
It also helps with security, since the repository is cryptographically signed.
</p>
<p>
To install Regina and keep up-to-date with the newest version,
follow these instructions.
</p>
<p>
<b>You only need to follow these steps the first time you install Regina.</b>
After this, openSUSE's package manager will handle upgrades for you,
just like for any other openSUSE package.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Open a terminal (e.g., <i>Konsole</i> or <i>GNOME Terminal</i>).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Add Regina to your list of package repositories.
To do this, type the line below, replacing
<span class="placeholder"><tt>VERSION</tt></span> with your openSUSE Leap
version (e.g., 15.6):
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo zypper addrepo https://people.debian.org/~bab/rpm/regina/opensuse/<span class="placeholder">VERSION</span>/regina.repo</tt>
</p></div>
<p>For example, if you are running openSUSE Leap&nbsp;15.6, you would type:</p>
<div class="specific"><p>
<tt>sudo zypper addrepo https://people.debian.org/~bab/rpm/regina/opensuse/15.6/regina.repo</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li><p>
If you are running openSUSE Leap&nbsp;15.6, you will need to import Regina's
signing key manually. I'm sorry, openSUSE have caused so many problems over
the years and this time
<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper/issues/546">they broke key imports
for third-party repositories</a>.  Earlier versions of openSUSE worked fine,
and the bug has been fixed so hopefully later versions will work fine also.
On 15.6 however, you need to:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>download Regina's signing key:
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~bab/regina-key.txt"><tt>https://people.debian.org/~bab/regina-key.txt</tt></a></p></li>
<li><p>verify that the key you downloaded has the correct fingerprint
(the output from the following <tt>gpg</tt> command
should include the same 40-digit fingerprint
<tt>519A...38D9</tt> that is shown at the bottom of this page):</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>gpg --import-options show-only --import regina-key.txt</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li><p>import this as an RPM signing key:</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo rpm --import regina-key.txt</tt>
</p></div></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>
Now update the list of available packages.  To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo zypper refresh</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Unless you already imported the key in the previous step, you will now be
asked to import Regina's cryptographic signing key.
<b>Check that the fingerprint is correct</b> (the correct fingerprint is shown
at the bottom of this page), and then select <i>trust always</i>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Install Regina.  To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>sudo zypper install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's all!  You can now keep Regina up to date in the same way that you
manage your other openSUSE packages.
</p>
<p>
The fingerprint for Regina's cryptographic signing key is shown below
(see the line in bold).
If you wish to examine the key more carefully, including its links into
the web of trust, you can
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~bab/regina-key.txt">download it here</a>.
