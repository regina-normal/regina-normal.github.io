<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Debian:  Bullseye (Debian 11.x)</a></h1>

<p>
Debian 11.x (Bullseye) already comes with Regina, but this will
be forever fixed at version 5.1.
</p>
<p>
To keep up-to-date with the <b>newest version</b> of Regina,
follow these instructions.
</p>
<p>
<b>You only need to follow these steps the first time you install Regina.</b>
After this, Debian's package manager will handle upgrades for you,
just like for any other Debian package.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Open a terminal and grant yourself root privileges.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Install the <tt>debian-keyring</tt> package.  This will give you
Regina's cryptographic signing key (since Ben is a Debian developer).
To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>apt-get install debian-keyring</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li><p>
Add Regina's location to your list of repositories.  To do this,
<a href="../repos/regina-bullseye.sources">download
<tt>regina-bullseye.sources</tt> from here</a>
and copy it into the directory <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</tt>
(in the line below, replace <tt>~/Downloads</tt> with your real
download location):
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>cp -i ~/Downloads/regina-bullseye.sources /etc/apt/sources.list.d/</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
<b>Note the suffix .d on the directory name!</b>
You do not want to overwrite <tt>sources.list</tt>.
</p>
<p>
This file <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/regina-bullseye.sources</tt>
is just a short text file; its full contents are included
at the bottom of this page.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Update the list of available packages.  To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>apt-get update</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
If you see an error like <i>&ldquo;the method driver
/usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found&rdquo;</i>,
install the package <tt>apt-transport-https</tt> and try again.
</p>
<p>
If you see an error like <i>&ldquo;the public key is not available&rdquo;</i>,
it is possibly because you forgot to install <tt>debian-keyring</tt>
in the first step.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Install or upgrade Regina like you would any other package.  Type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>apt-get install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
This procedure only installs the main packages
<tt>regina-normal</tt> and <tt>regina-normal-doc</tt>, which is all that
most people will need.
</p>
<p>
Some tips:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
If you are a C++ programmer and you wish to build Regina into your own
projects, you should also install the package <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If you had previously added Regina's repository as a
single line in <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>, you can comment that line
out now (or just delete it).  The new file <tt>regina-bullseye.sources</tt>
encodes the same repository but with better security.
(The old apt-line will still work, so there is no urgency to change.)
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For reference, the file
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/regina-bullseye.sources</tt>
should contain the following text (and the spaces on the last two lines
are important):
</p>
