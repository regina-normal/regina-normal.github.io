<h1><a name="contents">Regina for Debian</a></h1>

<p>
Debian ships with Regina &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;.  However, the version of
Regina that ships with each Debian release is fixed (e.g., Debian&nbsp;10.x
ships with Regina&nbsp;5.1, and Debian&nbsp;11.x ships with Regina&nbsp;6.0.1).
</p>
<p>
If you wish to keep up-to-date with the <b>newest version</b> of Regina,
follow these instructions.
</p>
<p>
The instructions differ according to whether you are running the
bleeding-edge <a href="#unstable">Debian unstable</a>, or a formal
<a href="#release">Debian stable release</a>.
</p>
<p>
These instructions only install the main packages
<tt>regina-normal</tt> and <tt>regina-normal-doc</tt>, which is all that
most people will need.
If you are a C++ programmer and you wish to build Regina into your own
projects, you should also install the package <tt>regina-normal-dev</tt>.
</p>

<a name="unstable"><h2>Debian Unstable (Sid)</h2></a>

<p>
If you run Sid (the Debian unstable release), you can install Regina from
the usual Debian servers like any other package:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>example$ apt-get install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
Sid always ships with the latest version of Regina (though it may take a
day or two for new versions to appear on your Debian mirror).
</p>

<a name="release"><h2>Debian Stable Releases (Bullseye, Buster)</h2></a>

<p>
To keep up-to-date with Regina, you will need to add Regina's repository to
your list of software sources.  These instructions will show you how.
</p>
<p>
<b>You only need to do this once!</b>
Once you have done this, Debian will happily manage installation and
upgrades of Regina just like it does for any other package.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Open a terminal and grant yourself root privileges.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Install the <tt>debian-keyring</tt> package.  This will give you
Regina's cryptographic signing key (since Ben is a Debian developer).
To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>apt-get install debian-keyring</tt>
</p></div>
</li>
<li><p>
Download Regina's repository description, according to your version of
Debian:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Debian 11.x (bullseye):
<a href="../repos/regina-bullseye.sources"><tt>regina-bullseye.sources</tt></a></p></li>
<li><p>Debian 10.x (buster):
<a href="../repos/regina-buster.sources"><tt>regina-buster.sources</tt></a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>
Copy this repository description into Debian's sources directory
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</tt>, as shown below (replacing
<span class="placeholder"><tt>~/Downloads/regina-VERSION.sources</tt></span>
with the location of the file that you just downloaded):
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>cp -i
<span class="placeholder">~/Downloads/regina-VERSION.sources</span>
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
<b>Note the suffix .d on the directory name!</b>
You do <b>not</b> want to overwrite <tt>sources.list</tt>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Update the list of available packages.  To do this, type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>apt-get update</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
If you see an error like <i>&ldquo;the method driver
/usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found&rdquo;</i>,
install the package <tt>apt-transport-https</tt> and try again.
</p>
<p>
If you see an error like <i>&ldquo;the public key is not available&rdquo;</i>,
it may be because you forgot to install <tt>debian-keyring</tt>
in the first step.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Install or upgrade Regina like you would any other package.  Type:
</p>
<div class="example"><p>
<tt>apt-get install regina-normal</tt>
</p></div>
<p>
</ol>
<p>
If you had previously added Regina's repository as a
single line in <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>, you can comment that line
out now (or just delete it).  The new file that you just downloaded
encodes the same repository but with better security.
(The old apt-line will still work, so there is no urgency to change.)
