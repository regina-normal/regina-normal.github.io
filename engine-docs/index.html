 Software for low-dimensional topology<br />
 Copyright &copy; 1999-2021, The Regina development team </b></center><p>This documentation describes the functions, classes and related entities in the C++ calculation engine, as well as how these can be accessed through Python.</p>
<p>To start: visit the <a href="modules.html">Modules</a> page and take a look around, or browse through the classes <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Triangulation_3_013_01_4.html" title="Represents a 3-dimensional triangulation, typically of a 3-manifold.">regina::Triangulation&lt;3&gt;</a>, <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Link.html" title="Represents a directed knot or link in the 3-sphere.">regina::Link</a>, and <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1NormalSurfaces.html" title="A packet representing a collection of normal surfaces in a 3-manifold.">regina::NormalSurfaces</a>.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Although this documentation is written for C++ programmers, Python programmers have access to many of the same functions, classes, methods and so on. See the special page for <a class="el" href="pythonapi.html">Python users</a> for a summary of the differences between C++ and Python, and some of the extra features that Python offers.</p>

<p>Some third-party libraries included in Regina are not granted this exception, and must be removed from any build that is distributed on stores that cannot comply with the GNU General Public License (such as Apple's App Store). See the third-party licenses below for details.</p>
<h3>SnapPea and SnapPy</h3>
<p>Regina includes portions of the SnapPea kernel and its successor SnapPy, which it uses for some geometric calculations. The SnapPea kernel was originally written by Jeff Weeks. SnapPy, where this kernel is now maintained, is primarily developed by Marc Culler and Nathan Dunfield, with contributions from many people. SnapPy and the corresponding SnapPea kernel are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2 or any later version, as published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<h3>Normaliz Library</h3>
<p>Regina includes a copy of libnormaliz, which it uses to help with the enumeration of fundamental normal surfaces. Normaliz was written by Winfried Bruns, Bogdan Ichim and Christof Soeger. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<h3>pybind11</h3>
<p>Regina includes a copy of pybind11, which it uses to generate python bindings for Regina's native C++ code. The pybind11 library was written by Wenzel Jakob, and is distributed under a BSD-style license that is shipped with Regina's source code in the file python/pybind11/LICENSE.</p>
<h3>Python rlcompleter module</h3>
<p>Regina includes a modified copy of the Python rlcompleter module, which it uses for tab completion in the graphical user interface. The original rlcompleter module was distributed under the Python Software Foundation License Version 2; the full license and copyright notice are shipped with Regina's source code in the file python/regina/LICENSE.</p>
<h3>Orb Kernel</h3>
<p>Regina includes snippets of code from Orb, for use in importing and exporting files in Orb / Casson format. Orb is based on SnapPea (see above) with additional code written by Damian Heard, who has also given permission for his code to be distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. </p>
