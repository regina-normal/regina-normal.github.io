<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Only C++/Python programmers were affected by this issue.
</p>
<p>
The bug did <i>not</i> affect any of Regina's
knot/link polynomial computations.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To trigger this bug, you would have needed to be working manually with
single-variable Laurent polynomials in C++ or Python.  Moreover,
you would have needed a polynomial <tt>p</tt> for which:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At some earlier point in time,
the minimum non-zero coefficient of <tt>p</tt>
was for some exponent <tt>a</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p>Later on this coefficient became zeroed out, and so the minimum
non-zero coefficient of <tt>p</tt> became
<tt>b</tt>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<tt>a</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p>After this, you manually set an individual non-zero coefficient for
some exponent <tt>i</tt> in C++ or Python via the syntax
<tt>p.set(i,&nbsp;value)</tt> or <tt>p[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;value</tt>,
where this exponent <tt>i</tt> is in the range
<tt>a</tt>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<tt>i</tt>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<tt>b</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
This bug did not affect users who manipulated Laurent polynomials in
other ways, e.g., via arithmetic operations, or by setting coefficients in
bulk by passing a list of coefficients.

<p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Only C++/Python programmers were affected by this issue.
</p>
<p>
The bug did <i>not</i> affect:
<ul>
<li>the graphical user interface;</li>
<li>disjointness testing (which uses <tt>components()</tt> in its
implementation, but in a way that did not trigger this bug);</li>
<li>vertex and/or fundamental normal surfaces (which are always connected,
and therefore did not trigger this bug).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Essentially, to trigger this bug, you would have needed to create your own
normal surfaces in C++/Python code (e.g., by forming sums of vertex and/or
fundamental surfaces), and then call the specific routines in the specific
order as described above.
</p>
<p>
A workaround (if you are using Regina&nbsp;7.0&ndash;7.3) is, instead of
calling <tt>s.components()</tt>, to call <tt>(s*1).components()</tt>.
This has the effect of creating a new surface whose connectedness is not yet
known (which means the bug is not triggered).

</table>

<p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Only C++/Python programmers were affected by this issue: the bug did not
appear in the graphical user interface.
</p>
<p>
The bug only affected (i)&nbsp;triangle links in normal surfaces, and
(ii)&nbsp;triangle and tetrahedron links in normal hypersurfaces.
It did not affect vertex or edge link tests at all.
</p>
<p>
The bug only affected surface/hypersurfaces <i>s</i> that are
normalised but <i>not thin</i> triangle/tetrahedron links:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The symptom was that, if the thin link test was performed on <i>s</i>
first, before the corresponding normalised link test had been performed,
then any subsequent call to the normalised test on <i>s</i> would return an
empty list (i.e., it would incorrectly report that <i>s</i> is <i>not</i> a
normalised triangle/tetrahedron link).</li>
<li>The cause was essentially an over-aggressive caching of results:
the thin link test would &ldquo;remember&rdquo; a boolean existence result,
and then reuse it for both the thin and normalised link tests.
However, a &ldquo;no&rdquo; for the thin test should not imply a
&ldquo;no&rdquo; for the corresponding normalised test.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A workaround (if you are using Regina&nbsp;7.1&ndash;7.3) is to simply call
the normalised link test before the thin link test.  Subsequent calls to
<i>either</i> test on the same surface will then return the correct results.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
The two issues above are related:
<ul>
    <li>The issue with <tt>HomGroupPresentation</tt> simplification
    was the root of the problem.</li>
    <li>The issue with <tt>GroupPresentation::recogniseGroup()</tt> was
    a consequence of this, and indeed the <i>only</i> consequence&mdash;this
    was the only place where Regina was actually using the problematic
    <tt>HomGroupPresentation</tt> simplification code.</li>
</ul>
Specifically, if <tt>GroupPresentation::recogniseGroup()</tt> identifies
a group as an extension over <i>Z</i>, it calls
<tt>HomGroupPresentation::intelligentSimplify()</tt> to help identify the
precise monodromy.
<p>
Although this was an old bug that affected all users, it is nevertheless
easily to isolate the scope of the bug.
<p>
In particular, you were <i>not</i> affected if:
<ul>
    <li>you were just simplifying group presentations
    (not homomorphisms); and/or</li>
    <li>you were working with the group generators and relations directly
    (not using the text-based <tt>recogniseGroup()</tt>,
    i.e., the group &ldquo;name&rdquo;); and/or</li>
    <li>you were using group names to identify other types of groups (e.g.,
    the trivial group, or cyclic groups), not extensions over <i>Z</i>.</li>
</ul>
The root cause came from <tt>GroupPresentation::simplifyWord()</tt>,
which would not only simplify a word in a group, but potentially rotate
(i.e., conjugate) the word also.
The bug then appeared because the high-level <tt>HomGroupPresentation</tt>
simplification routines would use <tt>simplifyWord()</tt> to simplify images
and preimages of generators under a homomorphism.
<p>
To avoid simliar problems in the future,
<tt>GroupPresentation::simplifyWord()</tt>
has now been renamed to <tt>GroupPresentation::simplifyAndConjugate()</tt>,
in order to make its behaviour clearer.

<p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Only Python programmers were affected by these issues:
any C++ code that worked with bitmasks and/or cyclotomic field elements
(including Regina's Turaev-Viro computations) was unaffected.
Moreover, to trigger these bugs, you had to do the following in
<i<>your own code</i>.
<p>
To trigger the <tt>swap()</tt> bug:
<ul>
    <li>create fixed-width bitmasks of one of the types
    <tt>Bitmask8</tt>, ..., <tt>Bitmask256</tt> (the main
    <tt>Bitmask</tt> class was unaffected);</li>
    <li>swap two of these bitmasks in Python via the global
    <tt>regina.swap()</tt> function.</li>
</ul>
To trigger the <tt>Cyclotomic.negate()</tt> bug:
<ul>
    <li>hold a <tt>Cyclotomic</tt> object <tt>x</tt>,
    either by creating it yourself
    or by fetching it from <tt>Triangulation3.turaevViro()</tt> and/or
    <tt>Triangulation3.allCalculatedTuraevViro()</tt>;</li>
    <li>explicitly negate <tt>x</tt> in Python by calling
    <tt>x.negate()</tt> (the operator <tt>-x</tt> was unaffected).</li>
</ul>
<p>
It seems unlikely that anybody would have been affected by these issues:
<ul>
    <li>The fixed-width bitmasks are specialised classes,
    mainly used for optimisation in the C++ calculation engine.
    They were only made accessible to Python with Regina&nbsp;7.0.
    Moreover, they are not returned by other Regina functions: you would
    have had to explicitly create these bitmasks yourself.</li>
    <li>The heavily overloaded <tt>regina::swap()</tt> function is mainly
    for C++ users (as part of the shift in Regina&nbsp;7.0 to value semantics).
    Python users do not need such a function, since Python uses reference
    semantics (not value semantics), and assignment operations are cheap.</li>
    <li>The API documentation does not actually describe an overload of
    <tt>regina::swap()</tt> for fixed-width bitmasks, since no such function
    exists in Regina's C++ calculation engine.  You would have had to
    guess that this overload existed and tried to use it.</li>
    <li>Cyclotomic field elements are only returned from Regina's
    calculation engine when computing Turaev-Viro invariants.
    As invariants, Python users might want to compute these, compare them
    and/or hash them for fast lookup, but it seems unlikely that
    typical users would need to manipulate them arithmetically.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The cause of the <tt>swap()</tt> problem was that, as noted above,
Regina's C++ calculation engine does not overload <tt>regina::swap()</tt>
for fixed-width bitmasks (since they are so small that a specialised
swap function is unnecessary).
The Python bindings incorrectly declared a <tt>regina.swap()</tt>
overload for fixed-width bitmasks, but forwarded this to the C++ function
that takes the more general <tt>Bitmask</tt> type instead.
In Regina&nbsp;7.2, the Python bindings for heavily overloaded functions
such as <tt>regina::swap()</tt> have been rewritten to use typesafe
C++-casts instead of the old C-style casts to resolve the overloads,
thus preventing such an issue from occuring again.
<p>
The cause of the <tt>Cyclotomic.negate()</tt> function was much simpler:
the python name <tt>Cyclotomic.negate</tt> was accidentally bound to the
C++ method <tt>Cyclotomic::inverse()</tt> in the code that connects the
two languages.

</table>

<p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Only C++ programmers were affected by this issue.
If you only used Regina through Python or the graphical user interface,
then you were not affected.
<p>
The problem was triggered when the user called
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords, which)</tt>, and:
<ul>
    <li>the <tt>NormalList</tt> argument <tt>which</tt>
    contained exactly one flag (e.g., only <tt>NS_FUNDAMENTAL</tt>,
    or only <tt>NS_IMMERSED_SINGULAR</tt>, but not a combination such as
    <tt>NS_FUNDAMENTAL | NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY</tt>); and</li>
    <li>the optional <tt>NormalAlg</tt> argument (which
    specifies an enumeration algorithm) was <i>not</i> passed.</li>
</ul>
If these conditions were met, then the flag passed in <tt>which</tt>
would be ignored.  Instead:
<ul>
    <li>if the flag you passed was <tt>NS_LIST_DEFAULT</tt>, then Regina
    would compute immersed and/or singular vertex surfaces
    (i.e., it assumed the flags <tt>NS_VERTEX | NS_IMMERSED_SINGULAR</tt>
    instead);</li>
    <li>if you passed any other flag, then Regina would compute
    embedded vertex surfaces (i.e., it assumed the default flags
    <tt>NS_VERTEX | NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY</tt> instead).
</ul>
<p>
The problem did <i>not</i> occur if:
<ul>
<li>you did not pass the <tt>which</tt> argument (which is also optional),
e.g., <tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords)</tt>; or
<li>you passed multiple flags in the <tt>which</tt> argument, e.g.,
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords,
NS_FUNDAMENTAL | NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY)</tt>; or</li>
<li>you passed an additional algorithm argument, e.g.,
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords, NS_FUNDAMENTAL,
NS_ALG_DEFAULT)</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The cause of the problem was that versions 4.94&ndash;4.96 of Regina
contained <i>two</i> <tt>enumerate()</tt> functions: the modern function that
takes <tt>NormalList</tt> and <tt>NormalAlg</tt> flags, and an old deprecated
function that took a <tt>bool</tt> argument for whether to enumerate
embedded surfaces only.
If a single flag was passed (of the enum type <tt>NormalListFlag</tt>),
then the C++ priority rules for type conversions meant that this was
interpreted as a <tt>bool</tt> instead of implicitly calling the
<tt>NormalList(NormalListFlag)</tt> constructor.
Therefore the old function would be called instead.
<p>
This was fixed in Regina 5.0 by removing the old deprecated
function entirely.
<p>
It is easy to test whether you were affected by this issue:
<ul>
<li>You can examine your C++ code, to see if you were calling
<tt>NNormalSurface::enumerate()</tt> in the manner described above
(with exactly one <tt>NormalList</tt> flag, and without passing the
additional algorithm argument);</li>
<li>If you have saved your data to file, then you can see what enumeration
flags were actually used.  You can see these flags in the
graphical user interface at the top of the normal surface viewer,
or you can call <tt>list.which()</tt> in Python or C++.</li>
</ul>

machine, or &ge; 2<sup>63</sup> on a typical 64-bit machine).
<p>
There were in fact two bugs, both thankfully hard to trigger:
<ul>
<li>The operation (<i>x</i> mod <i>m</i>) was broken in the following
scenario:
    <ul>
    <li><i>x</i> was both negative and small enough to store as a
    native <tt>long</tt> integer; and</li>
    <li>the modulus <i>m</i> had at some stage been too large to fit
    into a native <tt>long</tt>, it had subsequently been modified through
    some arithmetic operations so that
    it was now small enough to fit into a <tt>long</tt>, but the calculation
    engine had not yet optimised its storage and was still using a large
    integer representation of <i>m</i>; and</li>
    <li>the modulus <i>m</i> was now small enough so that
    |<i>m</i>| &le; |<i>x</i>|.</li>
    </ul>
If all of these conditions were met then the mod operation did nothing
(i.e., it just returned <i>x</i>).</li>
<li>The gcd operation was broken precisely when computing
gcd(<tt>LONG_MIN</tt>, 0) or gcd(0, <tt>LONG_MIN</tt>).
Here <tt>LONG_MIN</tt> represents the lowest integer that can be stored
as a native <tt>long</tt> (typically -2<sup>31</sup> on a 32-bit machine,
or -2<sup>63</sup> on a 64-bit machine).
In this case the gcd would be missing a factor of two (i.e., it would
return <tt>-LONG_MIN</tt>/2 instead of the correct answer
<tt>-LONG_MIN</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>mod</tt> error could in theory affect Regina's algebraic code (e.g.,
matrix computations related to homology).  However, if you were simply calling
<tt>getHomologyH1()</tt> on 3-manifold triangluations, it is extremely
unlikely that you would encounter the bug.  The more dangerous scenario
is if you were using experimental (and more complex) algebraic code from
the git repository (and in fact, this is how the bug was spotted).
<p>
The <tt>gcd</tt> error was extremely rare, in that there was only one
pair of integers that could trigger it.  In theory this error could affect
normal surface enumeration, but here the symptom would have been both
mild and obvious: you would have seen vertex surfaces that were not
scaled down to their lowest integer multiple.
