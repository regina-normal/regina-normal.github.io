<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Only C++ programmers were affected by this issue.
If you only used Regina through Python or the graphical user interface,
then you were not affected.
<p>
The problem was triggered when the user called
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords, which)</tt>, and:
<ul>
    <li>the <tt>NormalList</tt> argument <tt>which</tt>
    contained exactly one flag (e.g., only <tt>NS_FUNDAMENTAL</tt>,
    or only <tt>NS_IMMERSED_SINGULAR</tt>, but not a combination such as
    <tt>NS_FUNDAMENTAL | NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY</tt>); and</li>
    <li>the optional <tt>NormalAlg</tt> argument (which
    specifies an enumeration algorithm) was <i>not</i> passed.</li>
</ul>
If these conditions were met, then the flag passed in <tt>which</tt>
would be ignored.  Instead:
<ul>
    <li>if the flag you passed was <tt>NS_LIST_DEFAULT</tt>, then Regina
    would compute immersed and/or singular vertex surfaces
    (i.e., it assumed the flags <tt>NS_VERTEX | NS_IMMERSED_SINGULAR</tt>
    instead);</li>
    <li>if you passed any other flag, then Regina would compute
    embedded vertex surfaces (i.e., it assumed the default flags
    <tt>NS_VERTEX | NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY</tt> instead).
</ul>
<p>
The problem did <i>not</i> occur if:
<ul>
<li>you did not pass the <tt>which</tt> argument (which is also optional),
e.g., <tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords)</tt>; or
<li>you passed multiple flags in the <tt>which</tt> argument, e.g.,
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords,
NS_FUNDAMENTAL | NS_EMBEDDED_ONLY)</tt>; or</li>
<li>you passed an additional algorithm argument, e.g.,
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords, NS_FUNDAMENTAL,
NS_ALG_DEFAULT)</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The cause of the problem was that versions 4.94&ndash;4.96 of Regina
contained <i>two</i> <tt>enumerate()</tt> functions: the modern function that
takes <tt>NormalList</tt> and <tt>NormalAlg</tt> flags, and an old deprecated
function that took a <tt>bool</tt> argument for whether to enumerate
embedded surfaces only.
If a single flag was passed (of the enum type <tt>NormalListFlag</tt>),
then the C++ priority rules for type conversions meant that this was
interpreted as a <tt>bool</tt> instead of implicitly calling the
<tt>NormalList(NormalListFlag)</tt> constructor.
Therefore the old function would be called instead.
<p>
This has been fixed in Regina 5.0 by removing the old deprecated
function entirely.
<p>
It is easy to test whether you are affected by this issue:
<ul>
<li>You can examine your C++ code, to see if you are calling
<tt>NNormalSurface::enumerate()</tt> in the manner described above
(with exactly one <tt>NormalList</tt> flag, and without passing the
additional algorithm argument);</li>
<li>If you have saved your data to file, then you can see what enumeration
flags were actually used.  You can see these flags in the
graphical user interface at the top of the normal surface viewer,
or you can call <tt>list.which()</tt> in Python or C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>
While you wait for Regina 5.0 to be released, there is a simple workaround:
in your C++ code, change your function call from
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords, which)</tt>
to explicitly pass an additional algorithm argument, as in
<tt>NNormalSurfaceList::enumerate(tri, coords, which, NS_ALG_DEFAULT)</tt>.

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>

<p>
This issue only appeared where large integers were present, and only then in
certain rare scenarios.  Here &ldquo;large integer&rdquo; means an
integer too large to fit into a native <tt>long</tt> type on a computer
(i.e., its absolute value is &ge; 2<sup>31</sup> on a typical 32-bit
machine, or &ge; 2<sup>63</sup> on a typical 64-bit machine).
<p>
There were in fact two bugs, both thankfully hard to trigger:
<ul>
<li>The operation (<i>x</i> mod <i>m</i>) was broken in the following
scenario:
    <ul>
    <li><i>x</i> was both negative and small enough to store as a
    native <tt>long</tt> integer; and</li>
    <li>the modulus <i>m</i> had at some stage been too large to fit
    into a native <tt>long</tt>, it had subsequently been modified through
    some arithmetic operations so that
    it was now small enough to fit into a <tt>long</tt>, but the calculation
    engine had not yet optimised its storage and was still using a large
    integer representation of <i>m</i>; and</li>
    <li>the modulus <i>m</i> was now small enough so that
    |<i>m</i>| &le; |<i>x</i>|.</li>
    </ul>
If all of these conditions were met then the mod operation did nothing
(i.e., it just returned <i>x</i>).</li>
<li>The gcd operation was broken precisely when computing
gcd(<tt>LONG_MIN</tt>, 0) or gcd(0, <tt>LONG_MIN</tt>).
Here <tt>LONG_MIN</tt> represents the lowest integer that can be stored
as a native <tt>long</tt> (typically -2<sup>31</sup> on a 32-bit machine,
or -2<sup>63</sup> on a 64-bit machine).
In this case the gcd would be missing a factor of two (i.e., it would
return <tt>-LONG_MIN</tt>/2 instead of the correct answer
<tt>-LONG_MIN</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>mod</tt> error could in theory affect Regina's algebraic code (e.g.,
matrix computations related to homology).  However, if you were simply calling
<tt>getHomologyH1()</tt> on 3-manifold triangluations, it is extremely
unlikely that you would encounter the bug.  The more dangerous scenario
is if you were using experimental (and more complex) algebraic code from
the git repository (and in fact, this is how the bug was spotted).
<p>
The <tt>gcd</tt> error was extremely rare, in that there was only one
pair of integers that could trigger it.  In theory this error could affect
normal surface enumeration, but here the symptom would have been both
mild and obvious: you would have seen vertex surfaces that were not
scaled down to their lowest integer multiple.
