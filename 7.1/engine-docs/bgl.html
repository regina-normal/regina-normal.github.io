<div class="textblock"><p >The namespace regina::graph provides an interface for various types of objects from Regina to work directly with the Boost Graph Library (BGL).</p>
<h3>Triangulations</h3>
<p >After including the header triangulation/graph.h, any object of type <code>regina::Triangulation&lt;dim&gt;</code> can be used directly as a graph with the BGL. Here the graph will be the <em>dual graph</em> of the triangulation: this is an undirected multigraph in which each node represents a <em>dim</em>-simplex of the triangulation, and each arc represents a gluing between two adjacent <em>dim</em>-simplices.</p>
<p >Triangulations implement several BGL graph concepts, including:</p><ul>
<li>vertex link graph;</li>
<li>edge list graph;</li>
<li>adjacency graph;</li>
<li>incidence graph;</li>
<li>bidirectional graph;</li>
<li>the read-only portions of property graph.</li>
</ul>
<p >Triangulations are <em>not</em> mutable graphs - for the purposes of the BGL, they are considered read-only.</p>
<p >Dual vertices of the graph represent <em>dim</em>-dimensional simplices of the underlying triangulation, and so are represented directly by a pointer of type <code><a class="el" href="group__generic.html#gad4bfc8e4b6a2b1452937e33f56ab9eb3" title="Refers to a top-dimensional simplex in a dim-dimensional triangulation.">regina::Simplex&lt;dim&gt;</a>*</code>. Dual edges (when accessed through the BGL) must come with an orientation, and so are represented by lightweight objects of type regina::graph::DualEdge&lt;dim&gt;.</p>
<h3>Knots and links</h3>
<p >After including the header link/graph.h, any object of type <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Link.html" title="Represents a directed knot or link in the 3-sphere.">regina::Link</a> can be used directly as a graph with the BGL. Here the graph will be the underlying 4-valent directed multigraph of the link: every crossing of the link becomes a vertex of the graph, and every directed arc between crossings becomes a directed edge. Zero-crossing unknot components of a link do not appear in this graph at all.</p>
<p >Knots and links implement several BGL graph concepts, including:</p><ul>
<li>vertex link graph;</li>
<li>edge list graph;</li>
<li>adjacency graph;</li>
<li>incidence graph;</li>
<li>bidirectional graph;</li>
<li>the read-only portions of property graph.</li>
</ul>
<p >Knots and links are <em>not</em> mutable graphs - for the purposes of the BGL, they are considered read-only.</p>
<p >Vertices of the graph are represented directly by a pointer of type <code><a class="el" href="classregina_1_1Crossing.html" title="Represents a single crossing in a link diagram.">regina::Crossing</a>*</code>. Directed edges are represented by lightweight <code><a class="el" href="classregina_1_1StrandRef.html" title="A reference to one of the two strands of a link that pass each other at a crossing.">regina::StrandRef</a></code> objects; see the <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1StrandRef.html" title="A reference to one of the two strands of a link that pass each other at a crossing.">regina::StrandRef</a> documentation for how a <a class="el" href="classregina_1_1StrandRef.html" title="A reference to one of the two strands of a link that pass each other at a crossing.">StrandRef</a> object is used to identify a directed arc of the link. </p>
