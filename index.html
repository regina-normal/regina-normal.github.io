<h2><a name="whatis">What is Regina?</a></h2>

Regina is a software package for 3-manifold and 4-manifold topologists,
with a focus on triangulations, knots and links,
normal surfaces, and angle structures.
<p>
For 3-manifolds, it includes high-level tasks such as 3-sphere recognition,
connected sum decomposition and Hakenness testing, comes with a rich
database of census manifolds, and incorporates the SnapPea kernel for
working with hyperbolic manifolds.  For 4-manifolds, it offers a range of
combinatorial and algebraic tools, plus support for normal hypersurfaces.
For knots and links, Regina can perform combinatorial manipulation,
compute knot polynomials, and work with several import/export formats.
<p>
Regina comes with a full graphical user interface, as well as Python bindings
and a low-level C++ programming interface.
<p>
See the users' handbook for a <a href="docs/featureset.html">detailed list
of features</a>.

<a name="macos"><h4 class="divide">Mac</h4></a>

Regina runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon machines.
It ships with its own copy of Python&nbsp;3, which is bundled inside
Regina's macOS app.
<p>
You can download Regina either from this website, or via the App Store
(for free of course).
Not sure which?  Start with the App Store version (but read below).
<p>

    </tr>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are some minor differences between the website and App Store versions.
The App Store version:
<ul>
<li>means that macOS will notify you of upgrades;</li>
<li>may support iCloud in a future release
(which is not possible for a website download);</li>
<li>is sandboxed for extra security, which limits file access through
Python and the command-line tools (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sandboxing is a security measure that comes with all App Store downloads:
it ensures that apps only access files that you explicitly choose
through the graphical file dialogs (<i>Open</i>, <i>Save</i>, etc.).
For Regina, this means that when you open a Python console or
run command-line tools (<tt>regina-python</tt>, <tt>regfiledump</tt>, etc.),
the <b>only personal files you can access are those in your
<tt>Downloads</tt> folder</b>. You can still access world-readable files,
such as those in your <tt>Applications</tt> folder.
<p>
<a name="windows"><h4 class="divide">Windows</h4></a>

Regina on Windows uses a standard point-and-click installer.
<p>
Regina now offers separate 64-bit and 32-bit versions.
Almost all modern machines are 64-bit, and this is probably the version
you want. If you are not sure:
<ul>
<li>On Windows&nbsp;10, go to
<i>Settings</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>System</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>About</i>
and look for whether you have a 64-bit or 32-bit operating system.</li>
<li>On Windows&nbsp;8.1, go to
<i>PC Settings</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>PC and devices</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>PC info</i>
and look for whether you have a 64-bit or 32-bit operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<blockquote><table cellspacing=0 border=0 align=center class="data"><tbody>
<tr><th class="first" colspan=2>Windows version</th>
    <th>64-bit installer</th>

</tbody></table>
</blockquote>
<p>
These packages <i>should</i> work with Windows&nbsp;11 also, but
Ben has not yet been able to access a suitable testing environment.
Any reports of success and/or failure are welcome.
<p>
At some point in the very near future,
<b>Regina will stop shipping 32-bit Windows packages</b>.
If you need a 32-bit installer, please mail Ben so he knows there is
still need for it.
<p>
When running the installer you may see a security warning,
such as <i>&ldquo;Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an
unrecognized app from starting ...&rdquo;</i>, or a message from
SmartScreen Filter that
<i>&ldquo;This program might harm your computer&rdquo;</i>.
This is because Microsoft has not added Regina to its database of
known applications.
Click <i>More info</i> or <i>More options</i>
and you should be able to run the installer anyway.</li>

<a name="linux"><h4 class="divide">GNU/Linux</h4></a>

You can download ready-made packages for several GNU/Linux distributions

These repositories integrate with your native package manager
(<tt>apt</tt>, <tt>dnf/yum</tt>, <tt>zypper</tt>, etc.)
to help you keep Regina up-to-date automatically.

Marc Culler, Nathan Dunfield and Matthias Goerner have

<p>
Of course, whilst the packages are written to work with any modern version

<a name="ios"><h4 class="divide">iPad</h4></a>

The iPad app is currently in hiatus.  It has not been updated since before the

Hopefully Ben will have time to do this some time during 2022.
<!--
The iPad app offers most of Regina's functionality (<b>now including
Python scripting!</b>), but not all.  For
example, the iPad version does not support some of the more exotic
import/export formats, and some mathematical functions are only
accessible through Python (such as isomorphism testing, or manifolds of
dimension &geq;&nbsp;5).

<h2><a name="new">What's new in version 7.1?</a></h2>
<p>
Regina has had the largest overhaul in its 20+ year history.
Some of these changes break backward compatibility, and everyone <i>should</i>
read <a href="https://regina-normal.github.io/docs/regina7.html">this quick
overview of the most important changes</a>.
<p>
In particular: the file format has changed, the native C++ interface
has been reworked to take advantage of modern language features, and
for the first time, Python is now a &ldquo;first class citizen&rdquo; with full
access to essentially all of Regina's native code.
<p>
Beyond all this, new features include:
<ul>
<li>Links can now self-frame (adding twists to give each component
zero writhe), they now support planar diagram codes, and you
can now build the link group directly.</li>
<li>New, heavily optimised code for enumerating finite index subgroups
given a group presentation (C++ / Python only).</li>
<li>Triangulations of all dimensions now support a much richer suite of
homology calculations (C++ / Python only).</li>
<li>You can now locate a generalised angle structure on an ideal
triangulation (C++ / Python only)</li>
<li>Each normal surface/hypersurface/angle structure list now keeps its
own snapshot of its triangulation.  You can edit, move or even delete
the original triangulation without causing problems.</li>
<li>New elementary moves on 4-manifold triangulations (thanks to Alex He).</li>
<li>New command-line tool DGT to triangulate manifolds from framed links
(thanks to Rhuaidi Burke).</li>
<li>You can now build a SnapPea triangulation directly from a Regina
link, and the meridian and longitude will be respected.</li>
<li>The retriangulate tool can now search Reidemeister graphs for
knots.</li>
<li>Changed the old &ldquo;PDF attachments&rdquo; in the user interface to
support file attachments of any type.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some features have been removed:
<ul>
<li>Transversely oriented normal surfaces (which were always experimental)
are now gone.  They will return in a future release in a way that
does not attempt to shoehorn them into the normal surface machinery.</li>
<li>Dimensions 9-15 are no longer included in the default builds.
If you need them, you can
<a href="buildtips.html#highdim">build from source
with <tt>-DHIGHDIM=1</tt></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python and C++ programmers:
<ul>
<li>Regina now uses the C++17 standard, and no longer uses boost at all.</li>
<li>As noted above, there have been major sweeping changes to the C++ API.
<a href="api/regina7.html">See here for details</a>.
Python users should require far fewer changes to their existing code.</li>
<li>Python now has full access to essentially all of Regina's C++ code,
wherever this makes sense.  It also has more natural iteration,
string representation, equality testing by value, and better
compatibility with Sage.</li>
<li>All of the code that was previously deprecated in version 6.0 has now been
removed entirely.  <a href="api/regina6.html">See the
6.x guide</a> for instructions on how to update your scripts.</li>
